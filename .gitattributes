# 1. Hide the HEAVY assets (CSS, Images, JS libraries)
static/* linguist-vendored

# 2. Hide ONLY your biggest HTML files (So Python can win)
templates/dashboard.html linguist-vendored
templates/base.html linguist-vendored
templates/index.html linguist-vendored

# Note: We are NOT hiding *.html anymore. 
# Smaller files (like login.html, resume.html) will still count!
